# NASA-Space-Apps-Challenge-2020
The following repository will show all the work carried out for the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2020.
It is about a visualization tool implemented by ML, capable to turn data from HEASARC, LAMBDA and CfA SuperNova 
into images, and a ML code devised to make predictions on the info stored by the satellite on its flight route.
The files will be uploaded little by little, as all the work is getting to be finished.
